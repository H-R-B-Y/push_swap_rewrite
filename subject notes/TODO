1. print operations
2. add check sorted function (dont need to split if already sorted)
3. free the operatons list
4. loop over operations to reduce down too double operations (rr = ra + rb)
5. look into validity of greedy pushing
6. look into maybe swapping the top elements if one is smaller
7. optimise quickselect to make use of the linked list instead of transforming it into an array
8. grab my graph creator to measure up against previous attempt

worst case scenario would be if the list is reversed?
how do we approach that
